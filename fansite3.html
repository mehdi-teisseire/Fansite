        <h2 class="legend-title">EARLY LIFE</h2>
        <p class="legend-text">
          Thomas Pesquet was born on February 27, 1978, in Rouen, France. He graduated from the Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen, France, in 1996. He received a master's degree in spacecraft design and control from the National Higher French Institute of Aeronautics and Space in Toulouse in 2001. Always passionate about aviation, he became a commercial airline pilot for Air France in 2006. His diverse background in aerospace engineering and commercial aviation would later prove invaluable in his career as an astronaut.

        <h2 class="legend-title">BEFORE SPACE</h2>
        <p class="legend-text">
          Before joining the European Space Agency (ESA), Pesquet worked as an aerospace engineer at the French space agency, CNES. He was involved in spacecraft design and space navigation. His experience as an Air France pilot included flying Airbus A320s and serving as a type rating instructor. He logged more than 2,300 flight hours on various commercial airliners.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          In May 2009, Pesquet was selected as a member of ESA's Astronaut Corps, becoming the youngest member of the European Astronaut Corps at the time. He underwent intensive training at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany, and completed basic training in November 2010. This training included scientific and technical disciplines, survival skills, and operating complex space systems.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          He participated in several space training programs including CAVES (Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills), which prepares astronauts for the challenges of long-duration spaceflight through underground expeditions. He also took part in NASA's NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) program, spending time underwater in the Aquarius habitat off the coast of Florida.

        <h2 class="legend-title">Proxima Mission</h2>
        <p class="legend-text">
          Pesquet's first spaceflight, known as the Proxima mission, began on November 17, 2016, when he launched aboard Soyuz MS-03 to the International Space Station. During this six-month mission, he conducted about 50 scientific experiments and performed two spacewalks. The mission was named after Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our solar system, continuing the ESA tradition of naming missions after stars and constellations.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          During his stay on the ISS, Pesquet became known for sharing stunning photographs of Earth from space on social media, helping to make space more accessible to the public. He conducted numerous experiments in physics, biology, and human physiology. His spacewalks included maintenance work on the station's external equipment and installing new hardware.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          The Proxima mission concluded on June 2, 2017, when Pesquet and his crewmate Oleg Novitskiy returned to Earth after spending 196 days in space. The mission was considered a great success, with all major objectives accomplished and valuable scientific data collected.

        <h2 class="legend-title">Alpha Mission</h2>
        <p class="legend-text">
          Pesquet's second mission to the ISS, called Alpha, began on April 23, 2021. This mission was historic as he became the first French commander of the International Space Station during Expedition 65. He launched aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft "Endeavour", marking a new era in space transportation.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          During the Alpha mission, Pesquet conducted even more complex scientific experiments and performed four spacewalks. The mission included installing new solar arrays to upgrade the station's power system and conducting research that could help prepare for future missions to the Moon and Mars. He continued his tradition of sharing spectacular photographs and videos from space, gaining millions of followers on social media.
        </p>
        <p class="legend-text">
          The mission concluded on November 8, 2021, after 199 days in space. Combined with his previous mission, Pesquet has spent a total of 395 days in space, holding the record for the most time in space by a French astronaut. His leadership during the Alpha mission demonstrated the growing role of European astronauts in international space exploration.

        <p class="legend-text">
          Following his successful missions to the ISS, Pesquet continues to be actively involved in space exploration. He serves as an ambassador for space science and exploration, particularly inspiring young people to pursue careers in science and technology. He is also involved in ESA's future mission planning, including potential lunar missions as part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon.
