          <p class="legend-text">
            Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (9 March 1934 – 27 March 1968) was a
            Soviet pilot and cosmonaut who, aboard the first successful crewed
            spaceflight, became the first human to journey into outer space.
            Travelling on Vostok 1, Gagarin completed one orbit of Earth on 12
            April 1961, with his flight taking 108 minutes. By achieving this
            major milestone for the Soviet Union amidst the Space Race, he
            became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and
            titles, including his nation's highest distinction: Hero of the
            Soviet Union.
          </p>
          <p class="legend-text">
            Yuri Gagarin's death occurred on March 27, 1968, during what was
            meant to be a routine training flight. He was piloting a MiG-15UTI
            fighter jet alongside his instructor Vladimir Seryogin near Kirzhach
            in the Vladimir Oblast region of Russia. The last radio contact with
            their aircraft was recorded at 10:30 AM, and just one minute later,
            at 10:31 AM, the plane crashed near the village of Novoselovo,
            killing both men instantly.
          </p>
          <p class="legend-text">
            The crash itself and its causes remained controversial for many
            years, with various theories emerging about what happened during
            those final moments.

          <h2 class="legend-title">SELECTION</h2>
          <p class="legend-text">
            The selection of Yuri Gagarin for the Soviet space program began in
            1959 when the USSR was seeking candidates for their first human
            spaceflight. The initial selection process identified 3,000 fighter
            pilots as potential candidates, which was then narrowed to 20
            promising candidates.
          </p>
          <p class="legend-text">
            During the rigorous training and testing period, Gagarin stood out
            not only for his excellent physical condition and technical skills
            but also for his exceptional personality. His humble background as a
            worker's son, his friendly demeanor, reliable character, and
            photogenic smile made him an ideal candidate from a political
            perspective.
          </p>
          <p class="legend-text">
            By early 1961, the group had been narrowed to just two cosmonauts -
            Gagarin and Gherman Titov. The final decision to choose Gagarin was
            made just days before the historic flight, with Titov serving as his
            backup. The selection was officially announced on April 8, 1961,
            four days before the mission that would make him the first human in
            space.

            I'll provide a concise summary of Yuri Gagarin's historic first
            spaceflight: On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human
            to journey into space aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft. The flight's
            key events: Launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 9:07 AM Moscow time
            Reached orbit successfully Completed one full orbit around Earth
